[calibration_offsets]
# Per-probe temperature calibration offsets (in °C)
# Format: "hardware-id" = offset_value
#
# Use this to correct systematic errors in cheap DS18B20 sensors.
# Many inexpensive sensors have offsets of ±0.5°C or more.
#
# Calibration procedure:
# 1. Place all sensors together in a stable environment
# 2. Let them stabilize for 10-15 minutes
# 3. Note the readings from each sensor
# 4. Calculate offset: offset = (actual_temperature - sensor_reading)
#    - If sensor reads LOW (e.g., shows 28.5°C but should be 29.0°C), offset is POSITIVE (+0.5)
#    - If sensor reads HIGH (e.g., shows 29.3°C but should be 29.0°C), offset is NEGATIVE (-0.3)
#
# Advanced calibration (more accurate):
# 1. Ice bath: Place sensor in ice water (0°C reference)
# 2. Note the reading, calculate offset
# 3. Apply offset here
#
# The calibrated values are shown in:
# - HTML dashboard (/)
# - Console logs
# - Prometheus metric: dash_temp_readings{probe="name"}
#
# Raw (uncalibrated) values are available in:
# - Prometheus metric: dash_temp_readings_raw{probe="name"}
#
# Example entries:
# "28-0123456789ab" = 0.5    # Sensor reads 0.5°C too low
# "28-0123456789cd" = -0.3   # Sensor reads 0.3°C too high
# "28-0123456789ef" = 0.0    # Sensor is accurate (optional, defaults to 0.0)
